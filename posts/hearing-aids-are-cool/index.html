    <p>Personal story time! I&rsquo;ve been wearing hearing aids since the 3rd grade. My folks drove me down to Florida State University to get a hearing test and a fitting for some new aids. I lost one of my first pairs in a cardboard box in a cabin in the woods and my parents didn&rsquo;t even kill me. In the intervening 30 years I&rsquo;ve been through a few sets of aids. My first few sets were <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=itc+hearing+aids">in-the-canal</a> (ITC) aids. My current set is a behind-the-ear (BTE) set.</p>

<p><img class="wp-image-52 size-full" src="https://dpritchett.net/images/hearing-aids/hearing-aids-are-cool.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300" /></p>

<p><em>Bow ties are cool! Fezzes are cool! Hearing aids are cool!</em></p>

<p>Each new generation of hearing aids offers better digitization and miniaturization technology. The latest ones I&rsquo;ve seen work like AirPods on steroids - not only am I streaming internet audio from my phone via Bluetooth, I also have different listening profiles that shift the real-time digital signal processing algorithms in the aids to better enable me to participate in different listening environments. The profiles include stuff like &ldquo;listening to music&rdquo;, &ldquo;talking face to face in a crowded restaurant/bar&rdquo;, and &ldquo;long-distance hearing outdoors&rdquo;. Â It&rsquo;s pretty interesting stuff! My personal favorite is the &ldquo;turn me off during fire alarms&rdquo; option where my aids magically switch to earplugs.</p>

<h2 id="pricing-and-availability">Pricing and availability</h2>

<p>Unfortunately for a lot of folks, health insurance and government benefits often don&rsquo;t cover congenital hearing impairments. I&rsquo;ve been quoted per-ear prices from $250/ear to $2000/ear to get a set of aids. You can imagine that there are lots of folks out there who&rsquo;d benefit from this sort of life-improving technology that aren&rsquo;t getting it. There are some startups out there working on bringing lo-fi hearing aids to the masses via booths in Wal-Mart and such. Those appear to be simple amplifiers without the personalized hearing profiles I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to afford on my aids.</p>

<p>There are also private companies like Beltone that sell hearing aids. You&rsquo;ll probably have a local storefront in your town that will be happy to help you with a hearing test and advice on a purchase. I&rsquo;ve never gone the private route though - <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/mshc/">university speech and hearing centers such as the local one operated by the University of Memphis</a> have always felt like a better setup for me in terms of personalized service, competitive pricing, and lack of conflicting incentives between the hearing-impaired client and the service provider.</p>

<h2 id="cool-add-ons">Cool add-ons</h2>

<p><img class="wp-image-54" src="https://dpritchett.net/images/hearing-aids/IMG_20170903_153640.jpg" alt="selfie of the author wearing a udirect 3 pendant" width="400" height="612" style="width: auto;" /></p>

<p><em>Wearing a uDirect3 pendant to allow bluetooth connection to my hearing aids. Humor me while I pretend I&rsquo;m Tony Stark.</em></p>

<p>In order to harness the aforementioned Bluetooth capabilities I wear a <a href="http://unitron.com/content/unitron/us/en/professional/hearing-solutions/accessories/hearing-instrument-accessories/udirect-3.html">pendant on a necklace</a>. The pendant itself has a battery, a Bluetooth radio, and a microphone. There&rsquo;s a wire attached to the top that serves as a necklace. The copper wire inside the necklace uses some sort of inductive force to communicate with the hearing aids themselves. Â There&rsquo;s also a lapel mic attachment I can ask others to wear if I&rsquo;m in a lecture situation and can&rsquo;t quite hear from a respectable distance. I&rsquo;ve used it a few times with my daughter on car trips. Â It was fun but the battery only lasted an hour or so. By contrast the necklace goes for about a full day.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-know-about-living-and-working-with-a-hearing-aid-user">What to know about living and working with a hearing aid user</h2>

<p>Not too much - we&rsquo;re just people. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if I focus intensely on your lips while we talk. Lip reading is a key skill. Folks with more profound hearing loss (my hearing is maybe <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> as good as normal ears) may need additional consideration and support. If you know someone who could use some hearing aids, look and see if there&rsquo;s a not-for-profit hearing clinic nearby! You may be surprised what you can find. If we&rsquo;re talking and you notice that I missed the joke, it&rsquo;s quite likely I didn&rsquo;t understand you.</p>

<h2 id="hearing-in-tech">Hearing in tech</h2>

<p>Working in tech provides some obvious benefits for hearing impaired folks. There&rsquo;s a whole lot of quiet time, a whole lot of text-based communications. I for one <em>love</em> chatbots, Twitter, IRC, and forums. I also love talking with friends, family, and coworkers face to face but I do occasionally need a little help or a few extra repeats and explanations in a dynamic environment. I like speaking at conferences and that&rsquo;s a pretty daunting experience for anyone. I&rsquo;m wondering if I shouldn&rsquo;t be more adamant about offering transcripts for conference talks. Maybe I&rsquo;ll lead the way by writing out transcripts of all of my own content. Advice welcome!</p>
