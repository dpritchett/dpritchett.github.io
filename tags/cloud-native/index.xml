      <description>Agile in the age of serverless, &amp;ldquo;cloud native&amp;rdquo;, and continuous delivery I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through a bunch of lean manufacturing and DevOps literature recently, namely The Goal, The Phoenix Project (again!), and now Continuous Delivery. The Agile Manifesto is referred to a good bit in the latter two texts, and it&amp;rsquo;s gotten me wondering how well the seventeen-year old chestnuts hold up.
Taken as a whole, the manifesto feels timeless and every bit as relevant as it was at the dawn of this new century.</description>
