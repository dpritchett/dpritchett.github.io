      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working with some friends at a local startup called Graph Story. They provide a hosted graph database solution using Neo4j. They are looking to build up some introductory content to help developers get started with graph databases, so I wrote them a series of posts. Here&amp;rsquo;s the first in the series: Graph Kit for Ruby Part 1: Letâ€™s Build a Recommendation Engine for a Spree Store.</description>

      <description>My current project involves a lot of data coming in from a legacy system. Luckily I have the production web site of the legacy system available to compare against at any time. These two things are helping me out a lot for spot checking.
I put them both in my ~/.pryrc file so that I always have them locally and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to pollute shared codebases with my pet tools.</description>
