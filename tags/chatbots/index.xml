      <description>For the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to get to work with #VetsWhoCode, a nonprofit dedicated to training and supporting veterans in transitioning to careers as civilian technologists. Talking with a current mentoring partner has had me suggesting an unreasonable number of interesting books. Each of the books we read help us become better, more capable people but no one&amp;rsquo;s going to have time to read all the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ve got your own life to live!</description>

      <description>Why Livestream?    So far Twitch streaming&#39;s gotten a good 50 people to check out this book project.   Livestreaming seems primarily popular among gamers but there is a growing niche for programming-oriented livestreams. I&amp;rsquo;m more into programming than gaming at this point in my life, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m streaming. Returning readers will already know about my upcoming book for the Pragmatic Programmers publishing company on chatbots.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten into a lot of research at work and at home. I&amp;rsquo;ll plant a little signpost here to start the log and then push out little updates as the research progresses.
Lambdas and Serverless Functions I wrote more on this for the Clear Function blog at How Can Serverless Functions Help Your Systems?
Here are some of the key quotes:
 Whatâ€™s so great about a serverless function?</description>

      <title>Hearing Aids Are Cool</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal story time! I&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing hearing aids since the 3rd grade. My folks drove me down to Florida State University to get a hearing test and a fitting for some new aids. I lost one of my first pairs in a cardboard box in a cabin in the woods and my parents didn&amp;rsquo;t even kill me. In the intervening 30 years I&amp;rsquo;ve been through a few sets of aids. My first few sets were &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;amp;q=itc+hearing+aids&#34;&gt;in-the-canal&lt;/a&gt; (ITC) aids. My current set is a behind-the-ear (BTE) set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
